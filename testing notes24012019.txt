testing

- testing the s/w 

* quality- customer perspective 
* meeting the customer reqs
* defect free product ER=AR

ways in testing 

*manual
*automation 

dev---> appln--->testers--> test cases * excel appln
* test management tool ( QC,ALM)

Prep check ER=AR 

----> ER<>AR---> defects---> dev(rectify)--->appln -->testers




Automation 
dev--->appln--->testers---> tools(robot)instructions has to be given by the testers ---> test scripts (ER=AR)---> ER<>AR---> defects---> dev(rectify)--->appln -->testers


tools 
* functional testing tool- testing functional reqs - testing for behavior /functional char 

eg- HP - QTP/UFT 
    IBM - RFT 
    ThoughtWorks- Selenium (open source tool)
    google- Selenium Webdriver 
    Borland - Silk test 


* non -functional testing tool- testing for non functional reqs- invisible,surrounding the functional reqs to work

  HP- LR
  cyrano- OpenSTA(open source tool)
  IBM - RPT
  Borland- SILK performer 
    


* test management tool- STLC - s/w testing life cycle -managing the entire STLC 

  HP- QC/ALM
  bugzilla (open source tool)
  test directory

Principles of testing 

- Testing shows presence of defect

- exhaustive testing is impossible 

- defect clustering 

- as early as SDLC 

- testing is context dependant 

- Pesticide paradox 

- absence of error fallacy

QA                

- process oriented - process than product 
-documentation 

-prevention team-proactive team 

-verfication - are we building the product right - during the developement of the appln 

-reviews



-assuring the client 


 QC 

-product oriented 
-reduction team
-validation - are we building the right product 

- after the development fo the appln 

   

testing types
1. static testing - verification -techniques
 reviews
2. dynamic testing -validation 

  1.structural based testing or WBT 
  * statement coverage
  * decision coverage
  * condition coverage
  * cylomatic complexity 
  2.functional based testing or BBT
  * equivalance partioning 
  * boundary value analysis 
  * decision table testing 
  *state transition testing 
  3.experienced based testing
  * error guessing 
  * exploration testing 

 when to start & stop testing 

- as early as SDLC

- when there is a appln with 99.9% defect free
- major / critcal reqs are working 
- budget is over 


STLC - s/w testing life cycle

SDLC 
- req gathering- information from client to orgn (business analyst) 
  SME -subject matter expert  

 modes 
 - self based 
 - class room training 
 - calls - conference calls 

- req analysis - understand the reqs - can we develop the appln - implement the appln 

-feasible to implement the reqs 
-checklist 
* correntness
* completeness
* consistency
* reduntancy
* discreperancy

1. what- what to test 
   what are the reqs to be tested 
  
   -Test Scope 
  * in-scope - what are the reqs to be tested 
  * out-scope- what are the reqs not to be tested

2. who

  Resource will test 
 -Resource ,staffing & needs 


3. when
  -Test Schedule -timings
  
4. where

  - Test Environment
   * h/w ,s/w , tools required for testing  

5. how

  - decision of manual or automation testing 

6. test delieverables

 - docs delievered after testing is completed 
 * test plan
 * test devcelopemnt - test scenario , test cases 
 * test environment 
 * test execution 
 * defect tracking 
 * test closure
 * RTM

7. risk analysis 

- occurrence of possibility of defect may happen to appln 

- providing soln to risk 


* contingency - 
* mitgation 

8.entry & exit creteria 

- when we can get into the area
- when we can move it of the area 

9. suspension & resumption 

stop - becuase there is no mesaning in testing -
everything  to be failed 

continue from where you have stopped - fixed - reduce the level of defect 


Test development 

execution of what is planned 

-preparation done for executing what is planned in test plan document 

- test scenario

-test cases design & test case execution 

Test Scenario

- high level of testing 
- end to end testing 
-overall testing

user cancellation 
req1.1 - providing PNR number- alphanumeric with 8 digit 
req1.2 - clicking - confirmation -popup 
req1.3- meesage - ticket cancelled
